          Some call <strong>Pono</strong> the boss, some idol, but the best word
          to describe him is master. He is indeed a <strong> master</strong> in
          this field. Whatever woes you have with your camera and lenses will
          surely be made better by this man and his team.

            >Trusted by photographers not only in Cebu and the Philippines but
            even by foreign professionals</span
          >. Once I had an issue with my camera and asked the official Nikon
          service center of the cost that would be incurred had I opted to have
          them repair it. It was high. The same repair costed lower than half of
          Nikon's quote when done by Pono electronics. No wonder they never run
          out of clients. Only thing holding me from giving 5 stars is that
          their shop does not have a proper parking area..</span
